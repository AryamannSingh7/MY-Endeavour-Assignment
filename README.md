# MY-Endeavour-Assignment

1.Open the client app and run the command npm i and do the same for api to install the dependencies
2.run the server.js file using npm start after changing directory to ./api and run the client using npm start on  the directory ./client using split terminals
3. change the API_URL to http://localhost:3000 if u want to run the app locally but i recommend to just review the code and use the deployed version.
